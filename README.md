# Customer-Segmentation-with-K-means

## Data Analysis and Visualization
1. **Age Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of customers' ages.
2. **Credit Card Default Cases**: Visualize the number of customers who have defaulted on their credit cards versus those who have not.
3. **Age vs. Income**: Explore the relationship between age and income.
4. **Years Employed vs. Income**: Examine the relationship between years employed and income.
5. **Education vs. Income**: Investigate the distribution of income across different education levels.
6. **Age vs. Debt to Income Ratio**: Analyze how age relates to the debt to income ratio.
7. **Pairplot Analysis**: Provide an overall view of relationships and distributions among all variables.

## Clustering and Modeling
1. **Data Normalization**: Normalize the dataset using StandardScaler.
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Apply the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment the customers into distinct groups.
3. **Cluster Visualization**: Visualize the clusters to understand the characteristics of each segment.
4. **3D Plot**: Create a 3D plot to visualize the relationship between education, age, and income across different clusters.

## Results and Insights
1. **Cluster Analysis**: Analyze the mean values of different variables for each cluster to understand the characteristics of each customer segment.
2. **Cluster Visualization**: Provide visualizations for the clustered data to facilitate understanding and interpretation of the segments.

## Conclusion
The customer segmentation analysis helps in identifying distinct customer groups based on their demographics and financial behavior. These insights can be leveraged for better customer relationship management, targeted marketing, and personalized service offerings.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all necessary Python packages installed. You can use the following command to install the required packages:
